The following code example shows how to list custom Amazon Transcribe vocabularies\.

    :param vocabulary_filter: The returned vocabularies must contain this string in
                              their names.
    :param transcribe_client: The Boto3 Transcribe client.
    :return: The list of retrieved vocabularies.
    """
    try:
        response = transcribe_client.list_vocabularies(
            NameContains=vocabulary_filter)
        vocabs = response['Vocabularies']
        next_token = response.get('NextToken')
        while next_token is not None:
